# Current Tasks
## Servo Control

The Servo Motor we have works from voltage of 6-7.4 V and cannot be powered directly from the Arduino. We have to use the DC Power Supply in the Glennan Lab.

**NEEDS TESTING**

Code is responsive. Arduino can receive inputs and output an angle between 0 and 180 degrees.

## Ultrasound

Code works and reports distance as well as duration. We could just report duration and have students do a characterization.
