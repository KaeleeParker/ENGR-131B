# Lab 2

The second lab takes advantage of the piezoelectric properties of 
crystals to make measurements use the oscilloscope and teach students 
how to measure analog voltages useing the Arduino interface. At the end 
of the lab, students will understand:

- Piezoelectricity
- Oscilloscope Functions
- Basic Data Acquisition
-- and, the difference between the Arduino and the Oscilloscope
